About
Building a mini app means you will get instant exposure to the 23 million World App users. All World App users already have an integrated wallet and free transaction fees on World Chain (part of the super chain). We will be working closely with teams that want to build a real app reaching millions of people this weekend.
To be considered for the Mini App bounties you MUST use any of the Minikit SDK commands found on our docs. Learn more: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJ0htHP6lb0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJ0htHP6lb0)
