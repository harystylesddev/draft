About
Uniswap v4 introduces Hooks, smart contracts that let developers customize swap fees, liquidity logic, and trading behavior at the protocol level. We’re calling on builders to create with Hooks across stable-asset and volatile-asset markets, and to reimagine how liquidity and trading dynamics can evolve within the Uniswap ecosystem.

Prizes
💡 Uniswap v4 Stable-Asset Hooks ⸺ $10,000
🥇
1st place
$4,000
🥈

A user interface is not required, but projects must provide clear evidence of functional code.
Each team must submit: TxID transactions (tesnet and/or mainnet) a GitHub repository, README.md, demo link or setup instructions, and a demo video (max 3 min).
