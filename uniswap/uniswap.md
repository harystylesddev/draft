About
Uniswap v4 introduces Hooks, smart contracts that let developers customize swap fees, liquidity logic, and trading behavior at the protocol level. We’re calling on builders to create with Hooks across stable-asset and volatile-asset markets, and to reimagine how liquidity and trading dynamics can evolve within the Uniswap ecosystem.

Prizes
💡 Uniswap v4 Stable-Asset Hooks ⸺ $10,000
🥇
1st place
$4,000
🥈
2nd place
$2,000 ×2
🥉
3rd place
$1,000 ×2
Build Uniswap v4 Hooks designed for stable-asset markets. Projects should explore novel applications of Hooks for synthetic lending, credit-backed trading, or optimized stable AMM logic.

Qualification Requirements
A user interface is not required, but projects must provide clear evidence of functional code.
Each team must submit: TxID transactions (tesnet and/or mainnet) a GitHub repository, README.md, demo link or setup instructions, and a demo video (max 3 min).

🪝 Uniswap v4 Volatile-Pairs Hooks ⸺ $10,000
🥇
1st place
$4,000
🥈
2nd place
$2,000 ×2
🥉
3rd place
$1,000 ×2
Build Uniswap v4 Hooks designed for volatile asset pairs. Projects should explore innovative Hook logic that enhances liquidity resilience, mitigates Loss Versus Rebalancing (LVR), or improves capital efficiency for volatile asset pairs.

Qualification Requirements
A user interface is not required, but projects must provide clear evidence of functional code.
Each team must submit: TxID transactions (testnet and/or mainnet), a GitHub repository, README.md, demo link or setup instructions, and a demo video (max 3 min).

IDEAS

Advanced Yield Strategy (Uniswap v4): On Zircuit, a custom Uniswap v4 Volatile-Pair Hook creates a dynamic liquidity pool. The Hook automatically adjusts fees based on market volatility and uses EIP-7702 to execute complex, gasless rebalancing strategies, maximizing yield for btcUSD/ETH pairs.

---

Custom AMM Logic (Uniswap v4): A Stable-Asset Hook modifies the constant product formula to minimize slippage for assets that should trade near 1:1 (e.g., a US Treasury bill token vs a European government bond token). The Hook automatically compounds and distributes yield to liquidity providers in real-time.

---

Solver Network (Uniswap v4): Solvers use custom v4 Hooks to create highly capital-efficient liquidity pools that back these perp positions. They profit by optimizing spread and funding rates.
